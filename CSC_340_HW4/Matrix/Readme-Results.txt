Results from Test:

	How many rows are in matrix A? 2
	Enter the values in row 1 of A:
	1 0
	Enter the values in row 2 of A:
	0 1
	
	Matrix A is:
	1 0
	0 1
	How many rows are in matrix B? 2	
	Enter the values in row 1 of B:
	1 2
	Enter the values in row 2 of B:
	3 4
	
	Matrix B is:
	1 2
	3 4

	Transposing B. . .B is now:
	1 3
	2 4

	A * B =
	1 3
	2 4

	A * 10 =
	10 0
	0 10

	A - B =
	0 -3
	-2 -3
