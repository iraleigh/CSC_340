Results from Test:

	Enter the degree: 3
	Enter coefficient of x^3:  1
	Enter coefficient of x^2:  1
	Enter coefficient of x^1:  3
	1x^3 + 1x^2 + 3x^1
	
	is degree: 3	
	Enter the power of the term you would like to change: 2
	Enter a replacement coefficient: 2
	Your polynomial is now:
	1x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x^1
	Create a second polynomial: Enter the degree: 3
	Enter coefficient of x^3:  3
	Enter coefficient of x^2:  2
	Enter coefficient of x^1:  1
	Enter a scalar to multiply it by: 2
	Your 2nd polynomial is now:
	6x^0 + 4x^0 + 2x^0
	
	Dividing it back to originalYour 2nd polynomial is now:
	3x^0 + 2x^0 + 1x^0
	
	The 1st plus the 2nd = 4x^0 + 4x^0 + 4x^0
	
	
	The negation of the 1st is:
	-1x^0 + -2x^0 + -3x^0	

Intructions to Compile:

        Please go into this directory using a Terminal/Command-promt
        and compile using g++

                e.g. Type: "g++ Main.cpp Resource.cpp" and run
                     the a.out file by typing "./a.out" (if using a
                     Mac or Linux system)

        Note: C++11 is not required to compile these files
